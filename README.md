This is an ongoing learning project with [issues that are listed here](https://github.com/devjona/address-book-hotwire/issues). 

:heart: Please keep in mind that I'm doing this on my *spare* time and cannot contribute a full-scale production-grade resources to this.

## Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to practice Ruby on Rails development with a focus on the following areas:
1. Database table relationships
    - Front-end and Model validations
1. Hotwire and Stimulus
    - Leveraging the Rails ecosystem to make responsive apps
1. Controllers than can receive and respond to:
    - HTML
    - JSON
    - TURBO_STREAM
1. MiniTest
    - System
    - Controller
    - Model
1. Lots of practice with forms
1. Working within Rails 6.1 and practicing adding some newer "standard" features onto an older verson of Rails

## Version info:
`Ruby: 3.0.3`

The rest of the details are in the `Gemfile`
